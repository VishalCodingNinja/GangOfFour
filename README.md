# Design Patterns

Design patterns are solutions to recurring software design problems encountered in real-world application development. These patterns focus on reusable designs and object interactions.

The 23 **Gang of Four (GoF)** patterns are generally considered foundational in software design. These patterns are organized into three categories: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral**. This repository provides source code examples for each of the 23 GoF patterns.

## C# Design Patterns

This repository includes the C# source code for each pattern in three different forms:

1. **Structural** - Uses type names as defined in the pattern definition and UML diagrams.
2. **Real-world** - Demonstrates practical programming scenarios where each pattern can be applied.
3. **.NET optimized** - Shows patterns fully utilizing modern C# and .NET features like generics, reflection, lambdas, and primary constructors.

## Creational Patterns

| Pattern          | Description                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Abstract Factory** | Creates an instance of several families of classes     |
| **Builder**          | Separates object construction from its representation |
| **Factory Method**   | Creates an instance of several derived classes        |
| **Prototype**        | A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned   |
| **Singleton**        | A class of which only a single instance can exist     |

## Structural Patterns

| Pattern          | Description                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adapter**          | Match interfaces of different classes                  |
| **Bridge**           | Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation|
| **Composite**        | A tree structure of simple and composite objects       |
| **Decorator**        | Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically           |
| **Facade**           | A single class representing an entire subsystem        |
| **Flyweight**        | A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing     |
| **Proxy**            | An object representing another object                  |

## Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern          | Description                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes a request between a chain of objects      |
| **Command**                 | Encapsulates a command request as an object      |
| **Interpreter**             | Allows inclusion of language elements in a program|
| **Iterator**                | Sequentially accesses elements of a collection   |
| **Mediator**                | Simplifies communication between classes         |
| **Memento**                 | Captures and restores an object's internal state |
| **Observer**                | Notifies multiple classes of changes             |
| **State**                   | Alters an object's behavior based on its state   |
| **Strategy**                | Encapsulates an algorithm within a class         |
| **Template Method**         | Defers steps of an algorithm to a subclass       |
| **Visitor**                 | Adds new operations to a class without modifying it |
